TASK:

Despite the length of this section, we will not do very elaborate step-by-step lab exercises, because of the diversity of Linux distributions and versions, and because they each customize their desktops, even if the underlying code base is the same. Trying to give exact instructions is an exercise in futility; not only are there many variations, they are susceptible to change every time a new version of a Linux distribution is released.

For the most part, this is not a problem. Graphical interfaces are designed to be easy to navigate and figure out, and they really do not vary very much, not only from one distribution to another, but even between operating systems. So, the only way you can get more adept at working efficiently on your desktop is to simply explore, play, and modify. The same points will apply to the next chapter, on graphical system configuration.

Linux is so customizable, probably very few people stay with the default look and feel of the desktop. You may as well get started now in making your desktop reflect your likes and personality.

Start by changing the desktop background to something that better suits your tastes; perhaps one of the provided backgrounds, solid color of your choice, or a personal picture that you can upload.
Next, select a theme from the available themes for your distribution that, again, suits your tastes and personality. Have fun and explore with this exercise.

SOLUTION:

The easiest way to customize your desktop is to right-click your desktop, which should open a menu. At this point, select Change Desktop Background or Default Desktop Settings depending upon which Linux distribution you are running.

This will open a window where you can then select available background pictures, a solid color background, or use a picture of your own that you Add to your Pictures folder in your home directory.

To change your theme, you may have noticed a tab in the window where you changed the background labeled Theme. If it is present, you can click on this tab and select one of the available themes or click on Customize to experiment with your own creations.

However, for GNOME 3, you can no longer do anything this way except to set the background. Instead, you have to run gnome-tweaks (or gnome-tweak-tool) and then scroll down to Theme or Appearance > Theme.

Remember, many other settings one might expect to actually be in the Settings menu are now configurable only through gnome-tweaks. This can cause a lot of frustration until you discover this fact
