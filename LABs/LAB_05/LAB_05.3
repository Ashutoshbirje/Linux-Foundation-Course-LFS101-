TASK

The basic operations will be the same here, whether you have a GNOME or KDE desktop, although exact procedures and choices may differ slightly.

Create a new text file on the desktop named lab.txt, using the graphical file manager.
Delete the file by sending it to Trash.
Verify the file is now in ~/.local/share/Trash, or a subdirectory thereof.
NOTE: You will have to get your file browser to show hidden files and directories, those that start with a .).
Recover the file and make sure it is in its original location.

SOLUTION

$ touch lab.txt

$ ls

$ gio trash lab.txt

$ ls

$ trash-listmv ~/.local/share/Trash/files/filename ~/Recovered/ 

$ ls

(If rm is used to remove file then it can not be found in trash)
