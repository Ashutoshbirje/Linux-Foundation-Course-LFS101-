TASK:

Find the latest modified file in /var/log.

SOLUTION:

You will have to open the file browser window and navigate to the /var/log directory. This will vary somewhat from distribution to distribution. On most recent distributions, you will click on Other Locations > Computer.

Navigate to the /var/log directory. Set the view option to List rather than Icon, and then click on the date.

$ ls -lt /var/log | head -n 2
