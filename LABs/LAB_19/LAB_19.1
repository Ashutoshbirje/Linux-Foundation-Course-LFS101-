TASK:

Create a new user, using useradd, and give the user an initial password with passwd.
Configure this user to be able to use sudo.
Login as or switch to this new user and make sure you can execute a command that requires root privilege.
For example, a trivial command requiring root privilege could be:

$ ls /root

SOLUTION:

$ sudo useradd newuser

$ sudo passwd newuser

$ sudo su newuser

$ sudo ls /root
