TASK:

With the newly created user from the previous exercise, look at the password aging for the user.

Modify the expiration date for the user, setting it to be something that has passed, and check to see what has changed.

When you are finished and wish to delete the newly created account, use userdel, as in:

$ sudo userdel newuser

SOLUTION:

$ chage --list newuser

$ sudo chage -E 2014-31-12 newuser

$ chage --list newuser

$ sudo userdel newuser
