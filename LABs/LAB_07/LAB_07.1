TASK:

Using the gnome-software application, examine the list of installed applications on your system.

SOLUTION:

The gnome-software application should be available on any recent distribution.  Exactly where it is in the menus might vary, but you should be able to find it at Applications > System Tools > Software. You can also launch it by typing gnome-software on a terminal window or hitting Alt-F2 and typing it.

Once you have the GUI open, you can click on Installed to see the list, which is probably not complete and will vary according to distribution and what you have installed.

Most distributions have other graphical applications that show the full list of installed (and available) packages organized into categories, many of which (but not most)  are applications.  On Debian-based systems such as Ubuntu, you can run synaptic. On OpenSuse, you can run Yast, etc.
