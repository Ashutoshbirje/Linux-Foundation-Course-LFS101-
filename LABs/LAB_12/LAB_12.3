TASK:

There is no shortage of online tutorials on the use of the basic editors available. One of the examples includes an interactive vi tutorial.

For emacs, it is as simple as starting the program (you do not even have to give a file name) and then typing Ctrl-H and then t. This will launch the built-in emacs tutorial.

You should take some time to familiarize yourself with these tutorials.
