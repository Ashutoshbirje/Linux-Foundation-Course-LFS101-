TASK:

You will need to become very comfortable with one of the editors widely available on Linux systems. In the following labs, we will concentrate on vi, which is on every Linux system and for which every system administrator developer develops at least some ability to use.

We should do similar exercises for emacs, which also has a wide user base and has many dedicated fans. However, given the limited amount of time, we recommend you do these labs as homework anyway, and if you are not already proficient with vi or emacs, just use nano or gedit for the course, as these simple editors have virtually no learning curve. Or if you are already familiar with an external product, just as Visual Studio Code (code), by all means, you can use that.

Keep in mind preferences are strong among individual Linux users and administrators. For example, your author finds vi very confusing because of its different modes, and never uses it unless forced to. Perhaps the reason we do not have labs as long for emacs here is because your author finds it much easier and more intuitive to use
