TASK:

You can convert two text files (you can create them or use ones that already exist since this is non-destructive) into PDFs, or you can use two pre-existing ones. Combine them into one PDF, and view the result. Do this using three different methods:

qpdf
qdftk
gs

If pdftk is not installed, you can try to install. However, if you are on a system for which it is no longer available, you will have to use qpdf or gs.
