TASK:

Check to see if the enscript package has been installed on your system, and if not, install it.
Using enscript, convert the text file /var/dmesg to PostScript format and name the result /tmp/dmesg.ps. As an alternative, you can use any large text file on your system. Make sure you can read the PostScript file (for example with evince) and compare to the original file. NOTE: On some systems, evince may have problems with the PostScript file, but the PDF file you produce from it will be fine for viewing.
Convert the PostScript document to PDF format, using ps2pdf. Make sure you can read the resulting PDF file. Does it look identical to the PostScript version?
Is there a way you can go straight to the PDF file without producing a PostScript file on the disk along the way?
Using pdfinfo, determine what is the PDF version used to encode the file, the number of pages, the page size, and other metadata about the file. If you do not have pdfinfo you probably need to install the poppler-utils package.
