TASK:

It is nice to have your current working directory as part of your prompt so that a quick glance will give you some information without typing pwd every time.

If you often work on multiple computers, especially if you network from one into another with ssh, it is very convenient to have the computer name be part of your prompt.

Put your current working directory in your command line prompt.
Put your computer (machine) name in your prompt.
Put both your current directory and computer name in your prompt.
How can you make this persistent, so that whenever you start a bash command shell, this is your prompt? 

SOLUTION:

$ echo $PWD

$ PS1='\w>'

$ PS1='\h>'

$ PS1='\h:\w>'
