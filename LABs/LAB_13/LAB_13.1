TASK:

Typing long commands and file names over and over again gets rather tedious, and leads to a lot of trivial errors, such as typos.

Deploying aliases allows us to define shortcuts to alleviate the pain of all of this typing.

Suppose you are a member of a project team that works in a common, shared directory for your project. This directory is located in /home/staff/RandD/projects/projectX/src.

When you are working on Project X, you often need to create and modify your files in this directory. It does not take too long before typing in: 

cd /home/staff/RandD/projects/projectX/src

gets tedious.

Define and use an alias named "projx" to do the above cd command for you.

SOLUTION:

$ cd ~

$ nano .bashrc

PASTE this into below content 
 
# Custom alias creation 
alias ASH='echo "ASHUTOSH"'
