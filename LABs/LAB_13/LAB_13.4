TASK:

You have been busy working with your Linux workstation long enough to have typed in about 100 commands in one particular bash command shell.

At some point earlier, you used a new command, but the exact name has slipped your mind.

Or perhaps it was a pretty complicated command, with a bunch of options and arguments, and you do not want to go through the error prone process of figuring out what to type again.

How do you ascertain what the command was?

Once you find the command in your history, how do you easily issue the command again without having to type it all in at the prompt?

SOLUTION:

$ history 

$ !n

$ !man
