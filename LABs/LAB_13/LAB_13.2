TASK:

Create a small file /tmp/ls, which contains just the line:

echo HELLO, this is the phony ls program.

Then, make it executable by doing:

$ chmod +x /tmp/ls

Pre-pend /tmp to your path, so it is searched before your usual path is considered. Once again, type ls and see which program is run: /bin/ls or /tmp/ls?
What are the security considerations in altering the path this way?
