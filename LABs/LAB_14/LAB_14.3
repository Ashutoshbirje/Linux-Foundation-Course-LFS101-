TASK:

In the following we give some examples of things you can do with the grep command; your task is to experiment with these examples and extend them.

Search for your username in file /etc/passwd .
Find all entries in /etc/services that include the string f‌‌tp.
Restrict to those that use the tcp protocol.
Now restrict to those that do not use the tcp protocol, while printing out the line number.
Get all strings that start with ts or end with st.

SOLUTION:

$ grep student /etc/passwd

$ grep f‌tp /etc/service

$ grep f‌tp /etc/services | grep tcp

$ grep -n f‌tp /etc/services | grep -v tcp s

$ grep -e ^ts -e st$ /etc/services
