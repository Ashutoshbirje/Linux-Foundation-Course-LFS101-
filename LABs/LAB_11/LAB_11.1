TASK:

Issue the command:

student:/tmp> cat /etc/fstab

Now type:

student:/tmp> mount

Compare the results. What are the differences?

Find another way to see a list of the mounted filesystems, by examining the /proc pseudo-filesystem.

SOLUTION:

Typically, mount will show more filesystems mounted than are shown in /etc/fstab, which only lists those which are explicitly requested.

The system, however, will mount additional special filesystems required for normal operation, which are not enumerated in /etc/fstab.

Another way to show mounted filesystems is to type:

student:/tmp> cat /proc/mounts
