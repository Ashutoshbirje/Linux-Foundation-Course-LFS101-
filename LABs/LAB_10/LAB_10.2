TASK:

We are going to launch a graphical program from a terminal window, so that one can no longer type in the window. gedit is an easy choice, but you can substitute any other program that does this.

The solution file contains a step-by-step procedure for putting jobs in background, bringing them back to foreground, etc. Please repeat the steps, substituting the program you are using if it is not gedit.

SOLUTION:

$ top &

$ jobs -l 

$ bg %[job_id]

$ fg %[job_id]

$ jobs -l

$ kill -9 [id]
