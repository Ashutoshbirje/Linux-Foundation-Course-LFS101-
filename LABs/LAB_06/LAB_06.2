TASK:

Change the timezone of your system to London time (or New York time, if you are currently in London time). How does the displayed time change?

After noting the time change, change the timezone back to your local timezone

SOLUTION:

On a GNOME desktop, click on System Settings > Date & Time or System Settings > Details > Date & Time, and note the current Location settings.

You will either have to click on Unlock to give the root password, or will be asked for it when you try to change the timezone, depending on your GNOME version.

Use the Region and City drop-downs to switch the region to Europe and the city to London, or type "London" into the Location widget and pick the proper location from the list that appears. (You may also just be able to click at the right place on a map of the world.)

Look at the clock, and note that the displayed time has changed. Now, set the timezone back in the same way.

On KDE desktops, the details are somewhat different, but it is not difficult to figure out how to do this, and it should take you less time to find the configuration methods than it does to describe them.
