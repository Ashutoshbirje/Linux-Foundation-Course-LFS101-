TASK:

Using graphical package management tools, find the dump package.

If it is not installed, install it.

SOLUTION:

On any recent GNOME-based system, you can run the gnome-software utility as we have described. You can either run it from some menu location, or from a command line, or by typing it after hitting ALT-F2.

On Ubuntu, use either the Ubuntu Software Center or synaptic. On any other Debian-based system, you can use synaptic.

On Red Hat 7-based systems, including CentOS 7, click on Applications in the top menu bar, then System Tools > Software.

On SUSE-based systems, you can click on the System Settings icon in the upper right corner (the wrench and screwdriver) and then System > YaST.

On any of these systems, you can then just type dump in the search box and proceed from there.

NOTE: We really cannot give you precise instructions here; things change too often from version to version and distribution to distribution. However, things are mostly pretty intuitive these days. Thus, once again, you will just have to learn to navigate through the menus until you find the package management interface, but once you get there, it is easy enough to play with.
