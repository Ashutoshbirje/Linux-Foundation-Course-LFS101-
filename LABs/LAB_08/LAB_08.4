TASK:

Find the init.d directory, starting from /, and then create a symbolic link from within your home directory to this directory.

Note that this SysVinit directory is no longer used much in systemd-based systems, but is usually kept for backwards compatibility reasons.

SOLUTION:

$ find / -type d -name init.d
$ cd ~
$ ln -s /etc/init.d .

Note you will get a lot of noise about trying to look at files and directories normal users are not allowed to examine. If you preface the find command with sudo these will not occur
